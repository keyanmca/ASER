	  <h1>About ASER</h1>
      <p>ASER– is a social service organization working towards a better society. True to its name, ASER perseveres to bring in a positive change by uniting people who share the common vision of a developed India, and pay back to the society which helped us.</p>
      <h1>Rural Education</h1>
      <p>India's rural areas have been left behind in the wake of high growth in A and B cities in India. One cause of rural poverty is the inability for children in rural areas to obtain basic education.One of primary missions of ASER is educating the thousands of village children who grow up illiterate. Measures will be taken to ensure direct donations to programs that assist in promoting rural education and literacy.</p>
      <h1>Child Labour</h1>
      <p>The plight of children is heartbreaking when they are bonded labour. Our Government is taking drastic steps to prevent child labour and encouraging literacy to develop. According to our constitutional article 45 — Universal Free Compulsory Education should be achieved.At ASER , we want to ensure that such child labour are rescued, rehabilitated and provided with education and the basic amenities like food, clothing and healthcare that is the right of any child</p>
