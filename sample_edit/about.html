<h1>About ASER</h1>
      <p>Formed on 4 January 2011, by a group of young corporate professionals with a philanthropic bent of mind, ASER Foundation finds innovative solutions to social issues in alignment with the business needs of companies and willingness of goodhearted individuals and institutions across the globe.<br/><br/>ASER– is a social service organization working towards a better society. True to its name, ASER perseveres to bring in a positive change by uniting people who share the common vision of a developed India, and pay back to the society which helped us.It's an independent, non-religious, non-political, registered non-profit organization in India. It works towards restoring basic rights to children, especially from India and works across levels from direct action to advocacy, mobilizing public opinion and policy change. It focuses mainly on the four basic rights of survival, development, protection and participation.<br/><br/>
        
  <strong>ASER</strong> underscores the fact that helping is not simply a matter of dispersing money but of making a deep, long-term commitment and casting a hard eye on results. The entire management and operation of ASER Foundation is in compliance with the principles of "Good Governance "and thus sets itself apart with its set norms of sustainability, scalability, accountability, transparency, credibility and effective leadership</p>
	
      <h1>Mission</h1>
      <p>Education - Development - Empowerment<br/>
        To contribute more meaningfully towards the upliftment of the downtrodden and use available resources optimally.<br/>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Action for social and education remedies</span> has defined its Role as Motivator, Guide, philosopher & Friend of Small organizations & Groups. “ASER” believes that, instead of stating and getting engaged in one activity, it should motivate many organizations to involve in that activity and get very good impact and larger reach out. The success of ASER's different Projects lies in this vision.</p>
    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <p>The ASER team comprises of engineers, educationists, development professionals, media personnel, corporates, workers, activists, PhDs, MBAs, CAs, civil servants, bankers, corporate professionals, consultants, who all bring their experiences and perspectives to the organization and are unified by the common vision of improving the future of our children.<br/><br/>
      ASER is a youth volunteer network that works with underprivileged children in India. We try to empower these children with English language skills and other necessary life skills to help them succeed in life and harness their true potential.
      ASER works to bring about a world in which every child attains the right to survival, protection, development and participation.<br/>
      When you see 30-40% of the Indian population spend over 70% of their total expenditure on food… when 50% of Indian children aged 6-18 do not go to school and when 62% of India's children below the age of 2 years are not immunized, what do we do? 
      We have two choices - be a bystander, or roll up our sleeves to do something… anything to change this situation.<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold">We at ASER Foundation have made the second choice.</span></p>
