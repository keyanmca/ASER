<h1>What We Do</h1>
      <p><strong>The Primary aim of ASER is-Education - Development - Empowerment</strong>.ASER Foundation finds innovative solutions to social issues in alignment with the business needs of companies and willingness of goodhearted individuals and institutions across the globe.We are working on projects like sponsoring children studies who cannot afford to go to school, inspiring children to attend school, providing them with different facilities that with aid them in completing their academic studies and make them self-reliant.<br/><br/>
      ASER Foundation adopted this novel concept of social venture capitalism to bring together business and social entrepreneurs to discover creative solution to complex social problem. This new platform would get people to think about their charitable giving, at the same time expanding horizons for funding sources to community wealth.</p>
	  
      <h1>Hurdles</h1>
      <p>If we can dare to dream, we can also overcome hurdles.Failure occurs only when we stop trying. We understand that hurdles are part of any pursuit and we move on with a strong belief that they can be tackled. A relentless pursuit is the answer to most of the agony we face from failure.<br/><br/>
        
      It is easy to share a vision but it takes more than that to realize and implement it at a grass root level. Some of us might be fortunate enough to be blessed with a good life. It becomes more meaningful when we do noble activities and give back something to the society we live in. At ASER, we consider it our duty to help the less fortunate ones achieve the basic standards of life.</p>

		<h1><strong>Events and Projects</strong></h1>
        <p>We have various events and projects running, which targets different sections of society.</p>
